// One of the biggest cybersecurity breaches to happen in the last 20 years was the breach that
// happend to yahoo.com. At first it was estimated that only a billion accounts had been hacked
// but upon further investigation it was assummed that around 3 billion accounts had been exposed
// . Verizon was in the process of purchasing yahoo when this happened so verizon was able to make 
// purchase at a very discounted price.

// the breach was a breach that aquired the login information for over 3 billion different yahoo 
// accounts. exposing their usernames and passwords and other sensative information that was 
// attached to these different accounts. the motive behing the maddness was to sell the information
// to different scammers on the dark web.

// it was believed that the attack was a "state sponsored" attack. Meaning that the hack was carried
// out by a foriegn government entity. No country had been named in specific but china and russia 
// were both persons of interest in the case.

// the people that carried out the attack used a phising method and sent emails to different yahoo 
// employees trying to find different databases that they could use. the hackers looked for the yahoo
// user database and the account management tool. once he found them he created a backdoor on the 
// yahoo server so that he would have continual access to the information.

// verizon bought yahoo and they said they have gone to great lengths to make sure that they are 
// transparent with the way that they interact with users. Yahoo required new passwords when they 
// out that the data breach had happened so that the hackers wouldnt be able to access accounts.
